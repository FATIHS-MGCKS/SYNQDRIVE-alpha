# SynqDrive Rental Architecture — Canonical Module Registry

**Purpose:** This is the **mandatory first routing point** for agents working on SynqDrive rental product and shared frontend/backend runtime domains — including frontend, backend, APIs, UI contracts, persistence, workers, schedulers, integrations, signals, and cross-module runtime flows. It is an index and governance authority — **not** a replacement for module-specific documentation.

**Normative audit standard:** [`MODULE_AUTHORITY_STANDARD.md`](MODULE_AUTHORITY_STANDARD.md) — mandatory for current-state audits, module directory structure, repository/Production evidence requirements, Production read-only safety, and promotion from `AUDIT_IN_PROGRESS` to `AUTHORITY_ACTIVE`.

**Central registry validator:** `bash architecture/scripts/validate-module-registry.sh`

**Last updated:** 2026-09-10 (Internationalization module authority promoted to `AUTHORITY_ACTIVE`)

**Inventory boundary:** The overview table above is the canonical complete module inventory as of 2026-09-06. Rows with `NOT_STARTED` are inventoried only — they are not audited, Production-verified, or safe for substantive work without following [`MODULE_AUTHORITY_STANDARD.md`](MODULE_AUTHORITY_STANDARD.md). Discovery evidence: [`MODULE_INVENTORY_DISCOVERY_2026-09-06.md`](MODULE_INVENTORY_DISCOVERY_2026-09-06.md). Do not infer module understanding from flat `architecture/*.md` mentions alone.

## Registry coverage status model

Registry coverage status answers: **Is there a usable architecture authority for this module?** It is separate from each module authority’s own native lifecycle, maturity, epistemic, and validation statuses.

Examples of **authority-native** statuses (not registry coverage): `CANONICAL`, `APPROVED_FOR_CANONICAL_MERGE`, `PRODUCTION_VALIDATED`, Bootstrap V1, Phase 4 resolution planning.

| Registry status | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| **`NOT_STARTED`** | The module name and a short inventory-level description are known, but no complete current-state audit or canonical module authority exists. |
| **`AUDIT_IN_PROGRESS`** | Reconstruction and documentation have started but remain incomplete. Partial documentation must **not** be treated as complete authority. |
| **`AUTHORITY_ACTIVE`** | A structured, usable, living module authority exists and **must** be consulted before substantive work. It may still contain explicit gaps or open questions. |
| **`SUPERSEDED`** | This registry entry is no longer authoritative. Agents must follow the named successor authority. |

### Status transitions (not automatic)

```
NOT_STARTED → AUDIT_IN_PROGRESS → AUTHORITY_ACTIVE → SUPERSEDED
```

Transition arrows are **not** automatic. Each transition requires the gates defined in [`MODULE_AUTHORITY_STANDARD.md`](MODULE_AUTHORITY_STANDARD.md). All future repository-wide inventory rows begin as `NOT_STARTED` unless a usable authority is verified. Finding flat `architecture/*.md` documents does **not** satisfy the standard.

### Inventory placeholder semantics (future repository-wide inventory)

When modules are added in the separate inventory workstream:

| Field | `NOT_STARTED` placeholder |
|-------|---------------------------|
| Registry coverage status | `NOT_STARTED` |
| Authority-native status | `N/A — inventory only` (exact) |
| Authority path | `—` (exact) |
| Transition on reconstruction | Set `AUDIT_IN_PROGRESS` as soon as authority reconstruction begins |

Do not add undiscovered modules in governance-only PRs.

### SUPERSEDED successor notation

Record an explicit successor using the prefix `Successor:` in one or more of:

- overview **Authority-native status** (for example `Successor: Battery V2`)
- overview **Mini description** (only when necessary)
- detail section **Successor** row (for example `Successor: [Battery V2](#battery-v2)` or `Successor: [architecture/battery-v2/](battery-v2/)`)

The successor must name a registered module or provide a resolvable registry anchor / authority link. Broken or unnamed successors fail central validation.

### Registry synchronization protocol

After **every substantive module workstream**:

1. Re-read the **overview row** for each affected module (always).
2. For `AUTHORITY_ACTIVE`, also re-read the **mandatory detailed authority section**.
3. For `AUDIT_IN_PROGRESS`, review partial detail/authority material when present.
4. `NOT_STARTED` does not require an active detailed section.
5. `SUPERSEDED` follows its documented historical section and successor pointer when present.
6. Modify this registry **only when registry facts changed** (module name, mini description, registry coverage status, authority-native status, authority path, scope, boundaries, mandatory entry documents, validation commands, successor, Last updated).
7. `AUTHORITY_ACTIVE` does **not** change merely because implementation code changed.
8. Report every affected module as `UPDATED` or `UNCHANGED` with before/after coverage status and reason. `UNCHANGED` requires an explicit review — never skip.
9. Cross-module work requires **independent review** of all affected rows.
10. Run `bash architecture/scripts/validate-module-registry.sh` before completion.

### Knowledge classification axes (authority artifacts)

When bootstrapping or updating authorities, use **three separate axes** — never merge into one status field:

| Axis | Examples | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Registry coverage status** | `NOT_STARTED`, `AUDIT_IN_PROGRESS`, `AUTHORITY_ACTIVE`, `SUPERSEDED` | Governed by this registry |
| **Epistemic state** | `CONFIRMED`, `INFERRED`, `HISTORICAL`, `UNKNOWN`, `CONTRADICTED` | What is known about a claim |
| **Decision / validation status** | `PROPOSED`, `EXPERIMENTAL`, `VALIDATED`, `PRODUCTION_VALIDATED`, `REJECTED`, `SUPERSEDED` | Maturity of a decision or change |

Follow the owning module authority’s exact schema where it defines equivalent vocabulary. Do not require every example status if the domain uses another documented equivalent.

---

## 1. Why this registry exists

SynqDrive has multiple living architecture authorities with explicit epistemic discipline, validation scripts, and cross-module boundaries. Without a central registry, agents risk:

- reading stale flat `architecture/*.md` memos as current truth
- silently reconstructing module knowledge per task
- conflating ownership across related domains (for example REFUEL detection vs fuel-station enrichment)
- treating an inventoried module name as if it were already audited and safe to change
- shipping behavior changes without updating canonical architectural memory

This registry routes every agent to the correct authority **before** code inspection or implementation.

---

## 2. Source-of-truth hierarchy

Apply this order when facts conflict:

| Priority | Layer | Role |
|----------|-------|------|
| 1 | **Code + verified runtime evidence** | What the system actually does today |
| 2 | **Registered module authority** (`AUTHORITY_ACTIVE`) | Canonical architectural memory, navigation, decisions, gaps, validation |
| 3 | **Supporting root-level phase/change records** | Historical evidence (`architecture/P1_*`, `architecture/BATTERY_V2_*`, etc.) unless a registered authority explicitly elevates one |
| 4 | **Plans, hypotheses, open questions** | **Not facts** — do not promote to architecture without evidence |

When code and registered authority disagree: **record the conflict**, investigate, update the authority in the same workstream/PR, and never silently overwrite either side.

---

## 3. Mandatory agent routing algorithm

```
1. READ this registry (SYNQDRIVE_RENTAL_ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. READ MODULE_AUTHORITY_STANDARD.md when status is NOT_STARTED or AUDIT_IN_PROGRESS
3. FIND module in inventory overview table
4. BRANCH on registry coverage status:
     AUTHORITY_ACTIVE:
       a. Read all mandatory entry documents (detailed sections below)
       b. Read cross-referenced owning authorities when boundaries overlap
       c. Check open questions / contradictions before assuming facts
     NOT_STARTED:
       a. Treat as NO authority — do not assume understanding from inventory row
       b. Read and execute MODULE_AUTHORITY_STANDARD.md (Phases 0–5)
       c. Set AUDIT_IN_PROGRESS when reconstruction begins
       d. Update registry row + detailed section in same workstream/PR
     AUDIT_IN_PROGRESS:
       a. Continue under MODULE_AUTHORITY_STANDARD.md
       b. Read partial audit artifacts only — not complete authority
       c. Complete missing repository + Production audit surfaces
       d. Promote to AUTHORITY_ACTIVE only via standard promotion gate
     SUPERSEDED:
       a. Follow successor pointer; do not extend superseded authority
     ABSENT from inventory:
       a. Add row as NOT_STARTED (name, mini description, registry status)
       b. Then execute MODULE_AUTHORITY_STANDARD.md when substantive work is requested
5. IMPLEMENT with authority updates in same workstream/PR when substantive
6. RUN applicable authority validators
7. REPORT which authorities and change records were updated
```

### Scaling Process

| Field | Value |

| **Authority directory** | [`architecture/scaling-process/`](scaling-process/) |
| **Authority-native status** | **Bootstrap established** 2026-09-01 · Living architecture authority (not a final report) |
| **Ownership boundary** | Owns scheduler leader election, DIMO provider budget algorithm, reconciliation mutex, multi-replica deploy/rollback lifecycle. Shared infrastructure referenced by KG-ATE (leader, mutex, budget) — ATE documents usage, not algorithm internals. |

### Automatic Trip Enrichment (ATE) — KG-ATE

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Registry coverage status** | `AUTHORITY_ACTIVE` |
| **Scope** | Post-finalize trip behavior enrichment orchestration: enqueue/sync lifecycle, hardware-path routing (SMART5 HF vs LTE_R1 native), route/safety enrichment stage, misuse trigger, driving-impact job enqueue, reconciliation repair → enrichment chain, `behaviorEnrichmentStatus` FSM, UI/manual fallback paths. |

### Energy Event Detection (EED) — KG-EED

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Registry coverage status** | `AUTHORITY_ACTIVE` — a structured, usable authority exists and **must** be consulted before substantive EED work |
| **Scope** | REFUEL and RECHARGE detection, parsing, coalescing, persistence; `durationSeconds` vs `fuelLevelRiseDurationSeconds` semantics; sibling reconciliation; `VehicleEnergyEvent` and API DTO semantics; trip timeline energy card UI semantics. |
| **Authority directory** | [`architecture/knowledge-graphs/energy-event-detection/`](knowledge-graphs/energy-event-detection/) |
| **Authority-native status** | **`APPROVED_FOR_CANONICAL_MERGE`** per [GRAPH.yaml](knowledge-graphs/energy-event-detection/GRAPH.yaml) (`status` and `authority_state`; `main_sha_at_canonicalization: null`) and [README.md](knowledge-graphs/energy-event-detection/README.md) |
| **Lifecycle inconsistency (explicit)** | PR #1486 is **already merged** on `main` (merge commit `182731fe48cd25578668f102ed847f4791fbaabd`). EED’s own lifecycle metadata has **not** been promoted to `CANONICAL`. This post-merge promotion gap is an explicit documentation/lifecycle inconsistency requiring a **separate EED-authority follow-up**. Until that follow-up occurs, agents must **not** infer or silently assign `CANONICAL`. |
| **Ownership boundary** | **OWNS** all REFUEL/RECHARGE detection semantics, coalescing, persist gates, fuel-rise derivation, sibling reconciliation, energy API/UI contracts. **KG-ATE** may trigger `detectEnergyEvents` only — EED owns meaning. Fuel station enrichment trust detail is downstream (Tankstellenerkennung consumes persisted REFUEL events). See [governance/AUTHORITY_BOUNDARIES.md](knowledge-graphs/energy-event-detection/governance/AUTHORITY_BOUNDARIES.md). |

## 5. `NOT_STARTED`, `AUDIT_IN_PROGRESS`, and absent-module bootstrap

When registry coverage status is `NOT_STARTED`, or a module is absent and added as `NOT_STARTED`, the module is **inventoried only** — equivalent to having no authority.

**Execute [`MODULE_AUTHORITY_STANDARD.md`](MODULE_AUTHORITY_STANDARD.md)** — it defines:

- mandatory repository and read-only Production-VPS audit phases
- exact mandatory authority directory structure and file content
- Production read-only safety rules
- evidence and three-axis status requirements
- the promotion gate to `AUTHORITY_ACTIVE`

Summary: set `AUDIT_IN_PROGRESS` when reconstruction begins; inspect repository truth and applicable Production truth separately; never promote a deployed runtime-bearing module while `PRODUCTION_ACCESS_UNAVAILABLE`; update the registry row and detailed authority section in the same workstream/PR when promotion criteria are met.

**Existing flat `architecture/*.md` documents** remain supporting evidence. They do **not** automatically become canonical authorities and do **not** satisfy the standard.

---

## 6. Definition of done — architecture-affecting work

A workstream is **not complete** until:

- [ ] Affected registered authorities updated in the **same PR** when substantive behavior/architecture changed
- [ ] BEFORE / WHY / CHANGE / alternatives / expected effect / validation / observed effect / non-effects / tradeoffs / gaps recorded where applicable
- [ ] Open questions and contradictions updated — not silently deleted
- [ ] Cross-module boundaries consulted; every owning authority updated for cross-cutting changes
- [ ] Applicable module authority validators run (or limitation documented if validators require unavailable runtime deps)
- [ ] **Registry synchronization** completed for every affected module (overview row always; detailed section for `AUTHORITY_ACTIVE`; partial material for `AUDIT_IN_PROGRESS`; no active detail for `NOT_STARTED`)
- [ ] Registry metadata reviewed: module name, mini description, registry coverage status, authority-native status, authority path, scope, boundaries, mandatory entry documents, validation commands, successor, Last updated
- [ ] Each affected module reported as `REGISTRY_REVIEWED: UPDATED` or `REGISTRY_REVIEWED: UNCHANGED` with before/after coverage status and reason
- [ ] Central registry validator passes: `bash architecture/scripts/validate-module-registry.sh`
- [ ] Final agent report includes `ARCHITECTURE_GOVERNANCE` completion block (see [`.cursor/rules/Architectur-Updates.mdc`](../.cursor/rules/Architectur-Updates.mdc))
- [ ] This registry updated **only if** any reviewed metadata fact changed

---

## 7. Registry maintenance triggers

Update this file when:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Module **added** to inventory | Add overview row with name, mini description, registry status |
| Authority **created**, **renamed**, **moved**, **split**, **merged**, or **superseded** | Update overview row and detailed section; link successor for `SUPERSEDED` |
| **Registry coverage status** changes | Update overview table and routing behavior |
| **Authority-native status** or maturity changes | Update authority-native column; preserve historical note in module authority |
| **Entry documents** or graph entry points change | Update mandatory entry document links |
| **Validation commands** change | Update validation column |
| **Ownership boundaries** change | Update boundary text; ensure both sides of cross-graph contracts updated |

## Cross-authority quick reference

```
REFUEL detected?     → KG-EED
Station identified?  → Tankstellenerkennung (after REFUEL event exists)
Trip enrichment?     → KG-ATE
Driving behavior & impact? → Driving Intelligence (consumes trip boundaries; does not own Trip Detection/DIMO Segments, EED, or Tankstellenerkennung)
Battery health?      → Battery V2
Multi-replica/scale? → Scaling Process
```

Do not conflate confidence domains across Tankstellenerkennung and KG-EED. Do not document energy-event field semantics in KG-ATE.
