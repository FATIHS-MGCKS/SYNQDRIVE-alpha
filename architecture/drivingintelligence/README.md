# Driving Intelligence — Living Architecture Authority

**Status:** Retrospective expansion V2 (2026-09-06)  
**Maturity:** SUBSTANTIAL reconstruction — full workstream 2026-08-30 → present  
**Runtime impact:** None (documentation and knowledge graph only)

## What this is

`architecture/drivingintelligence/` is the **canonical architectural memory** for SynqDrive **Driving Intelligence** — the subsystem that transforms vehicle telemetry and trip boundaries into driving behavior understanding, operational load estimates, misuse signals, and API/UI projections.

It spans:

- DIMO telemetry acquisition (live + post-trip HF)
- trip-window association (DIMO Segments canonical)
- HF reconstruction and behavior event detection
- native DIMO driving events (LTE_R1)
- driving impact / stress scoring (V1 production)
- tire and brake **operational load proxies** (not measured wear)
- V2 durable post-trip pipeline (stage orchestrator, assessability, evidence)
- reference capture / HF recovery testbed (DI-EV-0035C / C.1x)
- rental and driver-subject aggregation
- health module inputs (brake/tire recalc)
- API and fleet/rental UI projection

## Critical system boundary

**Driving Intelligence does NOT own canonical trip boundaries.**

Trip start/end, segment authority, and live trip FSM belong to **Trip Detection / DIMO Segments**. Driving Intelligence **consumes** completed trips and enriches them.

**Driving Intelligence does NOT own REFUEL/RECHARGE energy events** (Energy Event Detection / EED). It may consume energy context for trip analytics but does not decide fuel/charge events.

**Driving Intelligence does NOT own fuel-station identification** (Tankstellenerkennung). Adjacent via trip timeline only.

Three confidence domains must never be conflated:

| Domain | Field / concept | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| A | `TripAssessability` dimension status | Whether a **data dimension** is assessable for this trip |
| B | `DrivingEvent` / `TripBehaviorEvent` provenance | Whether an event is **native provider-classified** vs **HF-reconstructed** |
| C | `TripDrivingImpact.drivingStressScore` | **Vehicle operational load** 0–100 — **not** driver quality or measured wear |

## Epistemic states (first-class)

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `CONFIRMED` | Supported by current code, tests, schema, or strong production evidence |
| `INFERRED` | Reasonable reconstruction; not yet fully verified |
| `HISTORICAL` | Was true in a past era; may be superseded |
| `UNKNOWN` | Not yet reconstructed — **not a documentation failure** |
| `CONTRADICTED` | Sources disagree; both recorded in `contradictions/` |

## Authoritative scope vs neighbors

| In scope | Out of scope (adjacent) |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Post-trip behavior enrichment | Live trip FSM / segment detection |
| Driving events & impact scoring | Energy event detection (REFUEL) |
| Assessability & misuse cases | Tankstellenerkennung |
| HF reference capture testbed | Map provider routing (Mapbox) — consumed only |
| Rental driving analysis aggregation | Battery SoC health (separate module) |
| Tire/brake **load proxies** from impact | Physical tire tread / pad measurement |

## Maintenance

Any substantive Driving Intelligence behavior change — scoring formulas, event thresholds, HF acquisition policy, stage DAG, job idempotency, assessability dimensions, load component semantics, API projection — **must** update this authority in the same workstream/PR when applicable.

See [AGENT_CONTRACT.md](./AGENT_CONTRACT.md).
